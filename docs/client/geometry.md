# Geometry

A geometry is property of a node. FEO nodes data includes both vector and raster data types as properties.

## Vector Data

Vector data represents geographic data symbolized as points, lines, or polygons.

Vector types include:

- Node geometries (or the area the node represents)
- Hydrobasins (watersheds)
- Exclusive economic zones
- Protected areas

Each of these exists as a 'Collection' that can be browsed and searched via several methods.

## Raster Data

Raster data represents geographic data as a matrix of cells that each contains an attribute value. Each cell in the raster data represents something, for instance buildings, roads, forests, etc.

To access a wide variety of geospatial data, covering vector and raster data types, you can use this [Jupyter Notebook on Github](https://github.com/transition-zero/feo-client-examples/blob/main/feo-client-examples/4_geometries.ipynb).
