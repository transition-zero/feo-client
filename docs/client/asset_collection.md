An asset collection refers to groups of assets. Using FEO you can access all assets within a specified geographic location.

To access data for assets and asset collections, you can use this [Jupyter Notebook on Github](https://github.com/transition-zero/feo-client-examples/blob/main/feo-client-examples/1_assets.ipynb).
