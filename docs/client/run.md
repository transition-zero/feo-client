# Run

Since each scenario corresponds to a probability distribution, performing a sensitivity analysis helps to explore uncertainty for a given scenario.

Sensitivity analysis involves tweaking different variables e.g. technology costs for a scenario and performing a new run. It will become possible to use FEO to conduct sensitivity analysis using runs and but for now runs data for existing scenarios can be accessed via the

To access data for runs, you can use this [Jupyter Notebook on Github](https://github.com/transition-zero/feo-client-examples/blob/main/feo-client-examples/3_system_model_results.ipynb).
