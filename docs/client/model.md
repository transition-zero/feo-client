# Model

Models are mathematical representations of the energy system. They help us with technology assessment and decarbonisation pathway studies. To do this they need to represent as reliably as possible various energy-related problems.

System models in FEO are composed of three objects - Models, Scenarios and Runs.

Models in FEO describe the geographic, temporal, and sectoral scope of the systems model.

To access data for models, you can use this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/transition-zero/feo-client-examples/blob/main/feo-client-examples/3_system_model_results.ipynb) on Github.
